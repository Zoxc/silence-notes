Do not add:
	Infer compile-time status of parameters.
	Implict conversion from values to pointers
	D like tuples: http://dlang.org/tuple.html - No varargs for types. Use a recursive type list instead
	Let function types take tuples

New variable syntax?	
	var a = 1
	var a, b
	var a int, b Struct(1, 2) # Allow types / data constructors after variable name?
	
	Replace : type specifier with space
	
Implement Callable on string types so you can do:
	struct String
		apply(v: String) -> String
	
	"val: " val " hello: " hello
		same as:
	"val: ".apply(val).apply(", hello: ").apply(hello)
	
	Means multiplication for integers?
		a b -> a * b
		(a + 2) 3 b -> (a + 2) * 3 * b
		
	No - Probably doesn't improve readability
	
Allow construction of non-copyable types by not requiring Copy typeclass on the initial assignemnt
	.var = Type("hello")
	var = Type("another") # not allowed if Type doesn't implement Copy
	
	.var2 = var # needs to handle this case. Make plain references require Copy?
		Does not allowing plain references handle all the cases when types might be copied?
		If so, 'var = Type("another")' could be allowed since it's not really a copy
		Does it handle return values? - No, return Type("Hm") would be allowed. It also doesn't generate an error when defining functions.
			Solved by making return and arguments of functions require Copy
			Handles the case of func(Type("hm")) too
			
			Return values doesn't have to be copyable.
			
			func()
				return Type("hello")
			.var = func()
			
			The object is never copied.
			
	Which values needs to have a Copyable type?
		Arguments passed to function applications (Callable typeclass can require this)
		Plain references to variables
			When the * or & operators are used this is not required
		The result of the * operator must be copyable, except when it's on the left hand side of assignment
		The result of the [] operator have to be copyable, except when it's on the left hand side of assignment
		
	Which values needs to have a Sizable type (not a opaque type)?
		Literals (already have a typeclass which can require Sizable)
		Variables/fields (would this be handled by the Constructable typeclass?)
		Constructor results (Constructable typeclass would require Sizable)
		The result of the * operator
		
	Copyable implies Sizable?
		
		Implement Copyable and Sizable by an integer on type variables.
			0 - Nothing
			1 - Sizable
			2 - Copyable and sizable
			
		On unification
			The highest value between two type variables are used.
			Checks that fixed types implements the right typeclasses
			
		Turn them into proper typeclass constraint when type inference is done
		
	Handle errors about Sizable and Copyable at the code generation stage?
		- No mess with typeclasses (so it's more efficient)
		- No need to infer typeclass constraint as much
		- Less friendly error messages
		
		Yes

Use whitespace for indentation? Yes
	Lexer generates START_BLOCK and STOP_BLOCK tokens? IDENT_CHANGE tokens?
	Emit error about whitespace/tab conflict to the parser which can ignore them they don't matter? (for say put(1, \n 2))
	Set a lexer flag when whitespace should be ignored?
	Have LINE tokens represent one newwline and possibly multiple empty lines and carry data about the identation level?
	How to handle mixed nesting of whitespace types? eg:
		put (
			if a
				2
				) # How to handle this being on the same indentation level as 2? Have a stack of braces level and pop the indenation until we find one which has it
		
		Have , allow a new type of indentation per line? Probably not
		
		Need a way to detect if a function has a body
		
		Optional braces:
			if a
			{
				# in if
				}
			
			if a {
					# in if
				}
		
			if a
				{ # brace must be at a whitespace level below the if, this uses whitespace indentation and is a new code block in addition to the if's
				}
		
		# Best idea
		Use an counter for disabling whitespace?
		Have scopes of blocks where "if a > 1" creates a new one based on the indentation the line it's on? Fall back to the old scope when done
		
		INDENT and DEINDENT tokens, send after LINE?		
		http://www.secnetix.de/olli/Python/block_indentation.hawk
		
		A process that skips all lines/comments at the start of a file and finds the first line with content. Use the indentation of that as the global scope indentation
